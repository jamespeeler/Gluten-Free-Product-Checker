# Gluten-Free Product Checker

This is a (very) simple site that will let you enter a product bar-code, and it will let you know if the product is gluten-free or not. I put this together for some of my friends that have a gluten allergy. 

## Usage

It's super easy to use!

Simply enter the 12-digit barcode of any food item (this includes the small numbers before and after the main barcode), and the site will let you know if it is gluten-free.
